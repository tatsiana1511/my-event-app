## Why
I think our home parties and hangouts should become more diverse and go beyond just eating and playing board games. There are a lot of talented people that can share their skills and make your event filled with great experiences.

## About the application
The idea of the platform is to **connect** event hosts and people who provide services for private parties.

An **event host** should be able to see all available experiences. Once logged in the option to book an experience comes up.

A **service provider** can sign up to become a member of the platform and add the services.
